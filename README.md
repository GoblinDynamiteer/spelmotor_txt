SPELMOTOR TXT

*This is a project for a course in C Programming, that I'm currently undertaking.* 

The program is used to run *Multiple choice text adventure-games* which is stored in external text files. 
Currently the games has to be written in a **very** specific format to work.

This is an experimental branch, in which i will try to use structs to load the content of the text file before playing. 
In the master-branch, the text file variable has to rewind frequently, which I feel is not a good solution.

A future project might/will be to build a program which the user can run to easily write new games.
