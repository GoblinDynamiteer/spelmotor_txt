#SPELMOTOR TXT

---

*This is a project for a course in C Programming, that I'm currently undertaking.* 

The program is used to run *Multiple choice text adventure-games* which is stored in external text files. 
Currently the games has to be written in a **very** specific format to work.

A future project might/will be to build a program which the user can run to easily write new games.

Currently, the code will only compile on a Windows-platform.
